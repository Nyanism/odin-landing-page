# odin-landing-page
Time to flex the things I have learned from The Odin Project

For this task, I have been provided with [an image of the desired landing page](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) that I was to code and style using Flexbox, as well as [the color and font styles](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png) that were to be used.
